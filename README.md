# Recipe Finder

Recipe Finder is a simple web application built with **React** and **Tailwind CSS** that allows users to search for recipes, filter results, and view detailed information about each recipe. The app fetches recipe data from an external API and provides a clean, responsive UI for browsing and discovering new dishes.

## Features

- **Recipe Search:** Enter keywords to search for recipes from the API.
- **Filtering:** Filter recipes based on categories, ingredients, or other criteria (depending on API support).
- **Recipe Details:** Click on any recipe to view detailed information including ingredients, instructions, and images.
- **Responsive Design:** The UI is styled using Tailwind CSS to ensure a mobile-friendly experience.
